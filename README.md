# CRIME ANALYSIS
CAPSTONE PROJECT FOR MACHINE LEARNING 
### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
Crime in Chicago has been worrisome to the Chicago PD. Reported crimes have been tracked
on a daily basis since 2001 and have been provided in the project data file. The Chicago PD
would like to drastically reduce the spate of violent crimes reported in the city. Being effective
involves knowing crime patterns and where they are likely to occur. It also involves equipping
the Police Department appropriately. They have recruited you to conduct full data analytics and
predictive modeling to uncover insights from the data that can be used to effectively mobilize
and respond to crimes in shorter time cycles. They are interested in gleaning any insights that
can help them determine What type of crimes to prepare for, Where these crimes are most
likely to occur, What days of the week and periods to expect these crimes

Conduct complete data analytics and predictive modeling to:<br>
• predict crime types by day type and district<br>
• Predict violent and non-violent crimes by day period and ward<br>
• Build a model to predict where the next crime would happen by District

### PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
This gives the security outfit the necessary information to curb crime by deploying their best hands and appropriate personnel to the fight cirme.

### LIBRARIES
- DATA MANIPULATION (pandas, numpy, warnings, datetime)
- DATA VISUALIZATION (seaborn, matplotlib)
- FEATURE SELECTION (SelectKBest, chi2)
- DATA PREPROCESSING (Minmaxscaler, Standardscaler, Normalizer, Labelencoder, Onehotencoder)
- DATA BALANCING (SMOTEEN)
- DATA MODELLING (cross_val_score, train_test_split, KFold, cross_val_predict)
- ALGORITHM (OneVsRestClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, LogisticRegression, GaussianNB, KNeighborsClassifier, SupportVectorClassifier, GridSearchCV, LGBMClassifier, CatBoostClassifier, XGBClassifier)
- EVALUATION (accuracy_score, auc, roc_curve, roc_auc_score, mean_squared_error, f1_score, precision_score, recall_score, confusion_matrix,  classification_report, plot_tree, export_text)

### DATA ANALYSIS
1. load the data
2. peek into the dataset (datatypes contained)
3. clean the dataset
4. feature engineering (added necessary columns)
5. encode the dataset
6. perform statiscal analysis
7. remove highly correlate columns
8. remove outliers
### FEATURE SELECTION
1. select the best features for prediction
### PREPROCESSING, BALANCING, MODEL, ALGORITHM, EVALUATION
1. scale the dataset
2. standardize it and 
3. Normalize
4. balance the preprocessed data
5. build the model
6. evaluation the model
7. plot the confusion matrix to get a better understand of how the algorithms performs.
8. hypertune parameters for better model performance. 

### REPEAT THE ABOVE FROM FEATURE SELECTION DOWNWARDS FOR THE OTHER PROBLEM STATEMENTS.
